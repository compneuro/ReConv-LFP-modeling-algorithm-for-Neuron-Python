  Reconstructing evoked LFP in cerebellar granular layer using jittered
  repetitive convolution (ReConv)

  This is the README for ReConv model for the paper

  Shyam Diwakar, Paola Lombardo, Sergio Solinas, Giovanni Naldi, Egidio
  D'Angelo.  "Local field potential modeling predicts dense activation
  in cerebellar granule cells clusters under LTP and LTD control", PLoS
  ONE, 2011 6(7):e21928

  Implementation was done by Shyam Diwakar in Neuron and Matlab. This Python version for Neuron+Python was implemented by Anandhu Presannan and Shyam Diwakar, Amrita School of Biotechnology, Amrita University, Kollam, Kerala, India.   


  Usage instructions:

  Attention: For running the model using python3, "tkinter" package is required. 

  The code, here, was originally meant for GNU/Linux systems. 


  Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive.  Then
  under:

  ----
  MSWIN

  run <b>mknrndll</b>, cd to the archive and make the nrnmech.dll.  Then double
click on the <b>mosinit.py</b> file.

When the "Control Panel" menu pops, click on "in vitro" for invitro to generate evoked LFP signal and after completing the simulation, quit and restart before running for "in vivo" simulations.


  ----
  MAC OS X

  run mknrndll, cd to the archive and make the <b>nrnmech.dll</b>.  Then double
click on the <b>mosinit.py</b> file.

When the "Control Panel" menu pops, click on "in vitro" for invitro to generate evoked LFP signal and after completing the simulation, quit and restart before running for "in vivo" simulations.

  ----
  Linux/Unix

  Change directory to the GrC folder. run "<b>nrnivmodl</b>". Then run
"<b>python3 mosinit.py</b>"

When the "Control Panel" menu pops, click on "in vitro" for invitro to generate evoked LFP signal and after completing the simulation, quit and restart before running for "in vivo" simulations.

Attention:
